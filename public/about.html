<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Sesing Tlhone, 34 years old, living in Bloemfontein. I have one son, Ofentse, and a loving partner Dineuoe</p>

<p>I have a B.Tech Degree in Information Technology. In my years of study, among other subjects, I was majoring in Software Development (C#).</p>

<p>Immediately after completing my B.Tech Degree, I worked in a Telecommunications company in South Africa, named Telkom. I worked in Telkom from 2012 up until the 31st of May 2023.
  I did not do a fully IT or developer related job in Telkom, as I was a Learning & Development specialist, dealing mainly with Instructional Design and LMS Administration, in this
  case, Moodle and SAP SuccessFactors LMS.
</p>

<p>I have left Telkom, and I am currently pursuing my aspiration of being a developer, having enrolled in a web development course on Udemy. The course focuses mainly on frontend development.</p>
